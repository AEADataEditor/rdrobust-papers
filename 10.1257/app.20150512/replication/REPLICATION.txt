This file documents the steps undertaken by (USER) to replicate the article
identified by the DOI represented by this directory.



Replication steps
=================

1. Add line to create a basepath for the local directory of APP2015-0512_data in config file
2. Add lines at the top of make_pols.do to do the config file, and to change directory to ${basepath}
3. In top level of APP2015-0512_data, create new directory output
4. In pols_graphs.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
5. In pols_graphs.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
6. In pols_graphs.do, change the address on line 25 to $fdata
7. In table_clearances.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
8. In table_clearances.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
9. In table_clearances.do, change all lines that begin with "eststo: reg ..." and contain i.egroups, to 2 separate lines:
	line 1: reg ...
	line 2: eststo
10. In table_main.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
11. In table_main.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
12. In table_main.do, change the address on line 26 to $fdata/elections_con_panel
13. In table_rz.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
14. In table_rz.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
15. In table_stocks.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
16. In table_stocks.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
17. In table_summary.do, change the address of global fdata to ${basepath}
18. In table_summary.do, change the address of global out to ${basepath}/output
19. Install following packages: winsor, binscatter, st0085_2, st0366 (including all ancillary files), 





Findings
========

Figure 1: No program provided
Figure 2: created by pols_graphs.do, looks the same
Figure 3: No program provided
Table 1: created by table_summary.do, numbers are approx. same, many off by 1 digit, but there are no exact matches.
Discrepencies could be caused by different software versions/hardware.
Figure 4: created by pols_graphs.do, looks the same
Table 2: created by table_main.do, visual inspection of numbers made, all numbers seem to match

Figure 5: created by pols_graphs.do, looks the same
Table 3: created by table_main.do, visual inspection of numbers made, all numbers seem to match
Table 4: created by table_stocks.do, visual inspection of numbers made, all numbers seem to match
Figure 6: created by table_stocks.do, looks the same
Figure 7: created by table_stocks.do and table_clearances.do, looks the same
Table 5: created by table_rz.do, visual inspection of numbers made, all numbers seem to match
Table 6: created by table_clearances.do, standard errors not included, but all numbers produced match
Appendix Tables/Figures: No programs provided


Classification
==============
[X] full replication
[ ] partial replication (see above)
[ ] not able to replicate (reasons see above)


Suggestions:
-create a global config file that allows you to change the addresses in all the do files at once
-list all packages needed to run the programs in the readme
