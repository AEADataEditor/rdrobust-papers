This file documents the steps undertaken by (USER) to replicate the article
identified by the DOI represented by this directory.

Replication steps
=================
(delete this line. Describe the steps you took to make the code work)

Findings
========
(delete this line and all subsequent lines. Describe your findings both positive and negative in some detail, for each Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers)
- Figure 1: Looks the same
- Figure 2: no program provided
- Table 1: no program provided
- Table 2: created by program1.do, visual inspection of numbers made, all numbers seem to match
etc.

Classification
==============
[ ] full replication
[ ] partial replication (see above)
[ ] not able to replicate (reasons see above)

**Tables 3 and 4 will not be replicable due to lack of access to confidential data 

Created basepath, go through every do file to modify path to replication files; would have to manually call the config file and each do file to record 
in log file, so instead created a main do file to call 

Error at line 43 of bootstrap_se_for_dynamic_Tables_8_9: 
file Results/boostraped_dynamic.dta could not be opened

Found problem was that had to alter the name using basepath as this problem shows up again on line 52;fixed all do files with this problem

Error at line 442 of bootstrap_se_for_dynamic_Tables_8_9: 
command ivreg2 is unrecognized
To fix, have to install ivreg2 w/ ssc install ivreg2, replace

Error at line 
command ranktest is unrecognized
Installed ranktest to fix problem

log file ran for over 20 hours and was stuck repeating the same lines of code for some reason; tried to make log files for each file to better see why it's repeating

Server crashed and stopped log file early, but was able to get a screenshot of the error before the program closed:
"file \\rschfs1x\share\statatemp\ST_8ca0_000001.tmp could not be opened"
