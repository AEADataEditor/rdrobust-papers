Replication steps
=================
1) Main .do file 
-Added logging
-Installed older rdrobust package: Add “net install st0366.pkg, from("http://www.stata-journal.com/software/sj14-4/") replace” to config.do
-Installed outreg2: Add “ssc install outreg2” to config.do 
-Installed kdens: Add “ssc install kdens” to config.do 
-Installed moremata: Add “ssc install moremata” to config.do 

2) Appendix .do file 
-Added logging 
-Installed older rdrobust package: Add “net install st0366.pkg, from("http://www.stata-journal.com/software/sj14-4/") replace” to config_appendix.do
-Installed kdens: Add “ssc install kdens” to config_appendix.do 
-Installed moremata: Add “ssc install moremata” to config_appendix.do 
-Adjusted matsize: Add “set matsize 450” to beginning of appendix.do
