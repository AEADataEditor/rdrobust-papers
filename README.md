# rdrobust-papers

This is a random selection of papers from within the set of [AEA journals](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/), which appear to use [`rdrobust`](https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust)

> Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell and Titiunik (2017): [rdrobust: Software for Regression Discontinuity Designs](https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdrobust/Calonico-Cattaneo-Farrell-Titiunik_2017_Stata.pdf?attredirects=0), Stata Journal 17(2): 372-404.

The purpose is to identify examples of the use of `rdrobust`. Nothing more.

The archive is organized by DOI of the article:

- [10.1257](10.1257) is the prefix used for AEA journals
- [10.1257/app.20130170](10.1257/app.20130170) is one of the articles.
